# What change with this fork?

jQuery-Waypoints was rewrite with Prototype-JS Framework 1.7, so jQuery is no longer needed to use this plugin. The behaviour of the plugin is still the same (unit tests were rewrite too).

# How to use it?

__$("my_id").waypoints(OPTIONS*);__

*OPTIONS are the same as the original jQuery-waypoints plugin. More information here : http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
